# Stray Dog Skin Disease Detection

## Overview
This project aims to detect skin diseases in stray dogs using computer vision and deep learning techniques. By analyzing images, the model can classify whether a dog has a skin disease, helping in early detection and intervention for animal welfare.

## Features
- **Automated Disease Detection:** Identifies skin diseases in stray dogs from images.
- **Deep Learning Model:** Uses CNN-based architectures for classification.
- **Preprocessing Pipeline:** Includes image augmentation and normalization.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Uses accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for performance assessment.

## Dataset
- The dataset consists of images of stray dogs with and without skin diseases.
- Images are labeled for supervised learning.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow/Keras
- OpenCV
- NumPy & Pandas
- Matplotlib & Seaborn

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/guruprashanth2004/stray-dog-skin-disease-detection.git
   ```

## Results
- Model performance is evaluated using various metrics.
- Visualizations of sample predictions are provided.
